    "# Exercise 1: Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read the following instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This jupyter notebook contains all the step by step instructions needed for this exercise.\n",
    "2. Write **efficient vectorized** code whenever possible. Some calculations in this exercise take several minutes when implemented efficiently, and might take much longer otherwise. Unnecessary loops will result in point deduction.\n",
    "3. You are provided with **some basic sanity checks**. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
    "4. Write your functions in the provided `hw1.py` python module only. All the logic you write is imported and used using this jupyter notebook.\n",
    "5. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) only. Any other imports detected in `hw1.py` will earn you the grade of 0, even if you only used them for testing.\n",
    "6. Your code must run without errors. During the environment setup, you were given a specific version of `numpy` to install (1.15.4). Changes of the configuration we provided are at your own risk. Code that cannot run will also earn you the grade of 0.\n",
    "7. Write your own code. Cheating will not be tolerated. \n",
    "8. Submission includes the `hw1.py` file and this notebook. Answers to qualitative questions should be written in markdown cells (with $\\LaTeX$ support).\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this exercise you will perform the following:\n",
    "1. Load a dataset and perform basic data exploration using a powerful data science library called [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data for linear regression.\n",
    "3. Compute the cost and perform gradient descent in pure numpy in vectorized form.\n",
    "4. Fit a linear regression model using a single feature.\n",
    "5. Visualize your results using matplotlib.\n",
    "6. Perform multivariate linear regression.\n",
    "7. Pick the best three features in the dataset.\n"
