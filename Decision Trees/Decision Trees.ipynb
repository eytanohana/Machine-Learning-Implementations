    "# Exercise 2: Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a Decision Tree algorithm as learned in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read the following instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This jupyter notebook contains all the step by step instructions needed for this exercise.\n",
    "2. Write vectorized code whenever possible.\n",
    "3. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
    "4. Write your functions in the provided `hw2.py` python module only. All the logic you write is imported and used in this jupyter notebook.\n",
    "5. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) only. Any other imports detected in `hw2.py` will earn you the grade of 0, even if you only used them for testing.\n",
    "6. Your code must run without errors. During the environment setup, you were given a specific version of `numpy` to install. Changes of the configuration we provided are at your own risk. Code that cannot run will also earn you the grade of 0.\n",
    "7. Write your own code. Cheating will not be tolerated. \n",
    "8. Submission includes the `hw2.py` file and this notebook. Answers to qualitative questions should be written in markdown cells (with $\\LaTeX$ support).\n",
    "9. You are allowed to include additional functions.\n",
    "10. Submission: zip only the completed jupyter notebook and the python file `hw2.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this exercise you will perform the following:\n",
    "1. Practice OOP in python.\n",
    "2. Implement two impurity measures: Gini and Entropy.\n",
    "3. Implement a decision tree from scratch.\n",
    "4. Prune the tree to achieve better results.\n",
    "5. Visualize your results and the tree."
